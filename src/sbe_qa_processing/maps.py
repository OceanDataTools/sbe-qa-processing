"""Natural Earth map data for the cast map, via cartopy.

cartopy downloads Natural Earth layers on first use into its data directory
(cartopy.config["data_dir"]). At sea without internet, run `sbe-qa-processing fetch-map-data`
beforehand; if a layer still can't be loaded, the map is drawn without it.

Natural Earth geometries are large (a land polygon can be a whole continent), so they are clipped
to the map view before plotting; otherwise every SVG would carry entire coastlines.
